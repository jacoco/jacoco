<h1>Contribute to JaCoCo</h1>

<p>
  From the very beginning JaCoCo was managed as a free and open project. All
  work artifacts like code, build results, discussions on mailing lists, the bug
  tracker and our wiki are publicly accessible. Many great features and bug fixes
  have been contributed by the community.  
</p>

<p>
  There are many ways to contribute to the JaCoCo project: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a well-structured bug report using the provided template that also
      comes with a executable reproducer.</li>
  <li>Provide a features request that comes with enough context information so
      everybody can understand the purpose and value of the feature.</li>
  <li>Share insights on our mailing list, especially if you have experience on
      specific platforms like mobile development, application servers or fancy
      build systems.</li>
  <li>Contribute to documentation, even if it's only about fixing typos.</li>
  <li>Test new features and snapshot builds and share your discoveries.</li>
  <li>Provide a idea how to fix a known bug or pending feature request.</li>
  <li>Provide a fix for a known or new bug as a pull request.</li>
  <li>Provide a new feature as a pull request.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The following topics provides a guide for successful contributions.   
</p>

<h2>Development Setup</h2>

Our standard development setup is based on the Eclipse IDE and is described
<a href="environment.html">here</a>. All contributions need to be in-line with
our <a href="conventions.html">development conventions</a>. Also some
information about the <a href="implementation.html">implementation design</a>
can be helpful to understand JaCoCo's internal.

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>
  All code contributions (even the contributions by the core developers)
  are managed by GitHub pull requests. Typically a pull request references an
  open issue (bug or feature request). Each pull request has to be complete
  in terms of features, testing and documentation before it can be merged
  into master. We consider the master branch as shippable at any point in
  time. This of course means that all builds on all supported JDKs must be
  green. Every PR is automatically built and the result is reported to the
  GitHub pull request.
</p>

<p>
  Pull requests will be reviewed and discussed by the JaCoCo project team. Once
  we decided to adopt a contribution we will help to get the everything cleaned
  up before the merge. During this process more commits might be added to
  address issues. If you
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/">allow edits from maintainers</a>
  the project team can do minor cleanups and the paperwork (e.g. change log)
  for external contributors directly.
</p>

<p>
  Once the PR is finalized all commits are squashed by the project
  maintainers and added to master as a single commit. 
</p>

<p class="hint">
  Before you start a bigger contribution please check whether we have an open
  issue for this (or open a new issue first) to make sure the JaCoCo project
  considers this in scope and the approach fits in the overall architecture.
  In doubt please get in touch through our <a href="support.html">mailing list</a> 
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>
  Keep your contributions as <b>specific</b> as possible. One thing at a time.
  <i>"I fixed this and that"</i> style pull requests typically are very hard to
  review and discuss as a single controversial aspect might kill the whole pull
  request.
</p>

<p>
  Also JaCoCo project is a code coverage library with some tool integration. We
  will not extend the scope to other domains (profiling, code metrics, etc.).
</p>

<h2>Technical Depth</h2>

<p>
  The JaCoCo team is committed to support the project in the long run. Therefore
  we do not accept any increase of technical depth in our code base.
  Contributions with questionable design, missing tests or poor code quality
  need to be reworked before they can be adopted. <i>"We fix that later"</i> is
  generally no option in the JaCoCo project.
</p>

<p>
  Please make sure your contribution follows the JaCoCo project's
  <a href="conventions.html">development conventions</a>.
</p>

<h2>Test Coverage</h2>

<p>
  JaCoCo is developed in a fully test-driven manner. We're nearly at 100% unit
  test coverage and have many automated integration tests to validate our
  features with every build. We expect every new feature to come with full
  test coverage. And of course we assume that all tests are green and stable
  before we review pull requests.
</p>

<p>  
  If you're unsure how to test certain aspects please come to our mailing list
  to discuss a solution. 
</p>

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<p>
  We want to keep JaCoCo consumable as free and open software. For this we need
  to stick with some basic rules for code contributions: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contributors (and if applicable their employer) need to agree that JaCoCo
      and so all contributions are published under EPL 1.0.</li>
  <li>Whatever is contributed has to be personal work or otherwise needs proper
      attribution to its original authors.</li>
</ul>
